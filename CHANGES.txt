PREVIOUS VERSIONS:

===== 1.3.4 - In App Store =====
Mar 17, 2013 - Build/submit date
Mar 21, 2013 - App store availability

* Update tor to 0.2.4.11-alpha (Mar 11, 2013). Moved back to alpha
  releases since 0.2.4.X introduces several security & performance
  improvements. Also eases future investigation of integrating obfs2 or
  other pluggable transports in the future. (This would allow Onion Browser
  to operate in areas where Tor is blocked due to deep packet
  inspection techniques.)

  The new "ntor" circuit-building handshake protocol[1] (with improved
  security and performance) is compiled into this version but will not
  be used until it Tor directory servers recommend[2] it.

===== 1.3.1 =====
Sep 12, 2012 - Build/submit date
Sep 18, 2012 - App Store accept date

* Support iPhone 5 (taller 4" Retina screen). Also compile openssl,
  libevent, and Tor for "armv7s" CPU target, which represents the new
  A6 processor. May improve performance on the iPhone 5 versus
  more generically compiled versions of those libraries.

* Bookmarking feature. Moved most of the "quick links" from startup
  page into "preset" bookmarks.

* Ability to configure Tor bridges. This is primarily geared toward
  advanced users that are using networks that attempt to block Tor via
  a "master list" of Tor nodes. See http://onionbrowser.com/help/
  for instructions.

* Major changes to underlying Tor wrapper code. May solve issues
  related to connection dying after the app has been open for some
  time and if the app was open while the device went into idle sleep.
  (Issue #2, Issue #3)

* Fixes CSS/JS on sites like meine-startseite.de, where statically gzipped
  resources are served (i.e. "foo.gz.css") automatically. HTTP code in
  Onion Browser now automatically handles these cases. (Issue #21)

* Fix issue where devices running iOS 5.1+ would work. Onion Browser
  should now work properly in all devices that have iOS 5.0 or higher.

* Update tor to 0.2.3.22-rc (Sep 11, 2012).


===== 1.3.0 =====
* Note: 1.3.0 was not released due to a bug discovered after original
  submission. 1.3.1 (above) contains and supersedes all changes that were
  originally slatedfor that version. All changes since 1.2.6 are listed above.


===== 1.2.6 =====
Sep 05, 2012 - Build/submit date
Sep 11, 2012 - App Store accept date

* Add warning message when clicking "New Identity" because of possible
  history leak: ":visited" CSS style still triggers on visited URLs
  despite clearing UIWebView history. (Issue #20 reported by sintime.)

* Closing the app while doing "initial connection" no longer causes
  connection to hang. App properly cancels connections/exits so that
  initialization retries properly on next app open.

* HTTP Pipelining can now be disabled. Can fix issues with some
  websites. (Based on issue reported by Jose C. M.)

* User-Agent spoof strings updated to Windows 7 Firefox 10 (matching
  TorButton) and Safari 6 Mountain Lion.

* Updated libevent to 2.0.20-stable (Aug 23, 2012)
